Saturn Valley Dotfiles of Doom
==============================

Contains jleen's lovingly hand-wrangled battle-scarred Unix config that has
been evolving for over two decades of fun-filled whimsy.

Installation
------------

Source zsh/startup.zsh from your zshenv.  Pass it a prompt title and prompt
color as arguments.

You don't need to do anything in
zshrc, vimrc, &c because we configure everything to look for your rc files
in the right place.  You can put your own stuff in a subdirectory called
"local" (which is gitignored).

Youâ€™ll need to manually update your .gitconfig. We could rewire it with GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL,
but too many tools automatically edit your gitconfig. You want something like:
```
[include]
    path = "~/sv/git/gitconfig"
```
